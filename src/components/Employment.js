                        <li>Streamlined the Dialog Flow agent release cycle by developing a Jenkins job with Python scripts that allows a user to archive an agent to source control with options to tokenize any parameter via a configuration file. The program was designed with modularity in mind such that a user can dynamically update the configuration file and any credentials for API calls whenever it is needed.</li>
                        <li>Developed a second Jenkins job that acts as the reverse of above where a user is able to select a tokenized agent from source control and restore it to its corresponding agent in any project group in Dialog Flow. A configuration file is used to determine what to replace the tokens with.</li>
                        <li>Designed an easy to use React single-page application that enables employees without direct access to the Dialog Flow console the ability to view any agent in any project and make simple edits to the agent's intent phrases. The user may also test that any given phrase maps to the correct intent.</li>
